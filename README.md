In this work, I used capsule network for anomaly detection task on imbalanced MNIST datasets created from original MNIST data.
The performance of the capsule network was compared against five baseline models (Random forest, XGBoost, deep neural network, isolation forest, and under complete deep autoencoder).

It was found that capsule network outperformed every other baseline model by training to only ten epoch.

The capsule network code is inspired from code provided by Aurélien Géron
