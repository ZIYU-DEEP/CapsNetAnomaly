In this work I used capsule network for anomaly detection task on imbalanced MNIST datasets created from original MNIST data.
The performance of capsule network was compared against 5 baseline models (Random forest, XGBoost, deep neural network, isolation forest and undercomplete deep autoencoder).

It was found that capsule network outperformed every other baseline model by training upto only 10 epoch.

The capsule network code is inspired from code provided by Aurélien Géron
